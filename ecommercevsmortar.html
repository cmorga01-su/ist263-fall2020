</section>

<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-6">

 <p>Ultimately, In this day and age the safer business venture would be e-commerce.  Heres why  </p>

<p>Cheaper Overhead - Overall the overhead cost of brick and marketing can be pretty pricey
 with monthly incurring fees. You must think about the issue of marketing – in print, online,
  on the radio, or on TV – and how those costs will affect your business’s stability. While
  paying for a domain name and payment processing service are the basic steps to starting an
   online shop, starting a true storefront typically requires a business loan or startup capital.
    You must pay for the space by renting, leasing, or buying the property; you must pay for
    stock for your store; you must pay for payment processing equipment; you must pay for shelves
    and display furniture; you have to pay for utilities; and you have to pay employees. <p>


<p> Marketing - Although you can apply this method of marketing to brick and mortar stores
 as well, you can still reach millions of people across the globe at any given time to access
  your store and purchase. So in terms of volume and reachability, you still have just as much
   as an opportunity to reach millions of people from the comfort of your own home. As a
   brick-and-mortar business owner, you must think about the issue of marketing – in print,
   online, on the radio, or on TV – and how those costs will affect your business’s stability.
   Brick and Mortar stores on average pay more for marketing due to the fact they have to use
   traditional methods of marketing to engage with their community. Traditional marketing often
   way more expensive than digital as well as being less effective.  </p>

<p> Manageability and Maintenance - The beauty of e-commerce is that it can be done virtually anywhere.
 Although bot models are time consuming, Brick and Mortar requires a lot more effort, in terms of
 managing a staff of people, oversight of the physical cash within the store, consistent and strict
  working hours, and possibilities store thief and more, digital stores require less maintenance
  and its on your own time at your own convenience  </p>

</div>


  <div class="col-md-6">
  <div class="row">

    <div>

<p> Although physical retailers account for 75% of all retail sales, we must take account the vast rate
  of which theses retail stores are dying. While brick-and-mortar storefronts are still an important
  and thriving business model, one of the most important draws into stores – foot traffic – is declining
  15 percent annually. </p>

<p> Overall, the most effective retail businesses incorporate both a digital and retail presence
 with seamless digital experience and interactive physical experience to allow customers to multiple
 ways to avenues to purchase as well as provide an easy shopping experience for customer. Even by
 providing basic eCommerce functionality such as ‘buy-online and pick-up in store’, brick and mortar
 stores can give customers what they like from the world of online shopping while maintaining the
 advantages that the physical storefront. If brick and mortar stores want to remain a force to be
 reckoned with, they’ll have to stay up-to-date with trends in the retail industry more generally,
  which includes eCommerce trends as well.  </p>

<p> The debate between the two business models isn’t an online vs offline battle, but rather a way to
 provide the best online and offline experience as a whole to the customer journey. These hybrid stores
  will represent the best of the past and the future. Perhaps most importantly, they will represent an
  end to the brick-and-mortar vs. e-commerce battle and the beginning of a golden, interconnected age
  for retail.  </p>
